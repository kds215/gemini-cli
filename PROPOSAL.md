Title: Proposal: Integrate "gemini --reader" feature into official @google/gemini-cli

Hello Google Gemini CLI maintainers,

I am the author of [@kds215/gemini-cli](https://github.com/kds215/gemini-cli), which extends the official CLI with a "gemini --reader" feature for enhanced accessibility. Due to recent security concerns with the upstream @google/gemini-cli, I have unpublished my npm release to ensure user safety.
These concerns are based on [arstechnica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/flaw-in-gemini-cli-coding-tool-allowed-hackers-to-run-nasty-commands-on-user-devices/) web page "Flaw in Gemini CLI coding tool could allow hackers to run nasty commands"

**Proposal:**  
I suggest incorporating the "gemini --reader" feature into the official @google/gemini-cli. This will ensure all users benefit from Google’s ongoing security and anti-malware measures.

**Benefits:**  
- Enhanced accessibility for visually impaired users.
- Leverages Google’s secure release process.
- Avoids fragmentation and duplication in the ecosystem.

**Links:**  
- My implementation: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kds215/gemini-cli)
- Feature overview: [README.md](https://github.com/kds215/gemini-cli/README.md)

I am happy to collaborate, provide documentation, and update the code to fit your standards.

Thank you for considering this proposal!

Best,
